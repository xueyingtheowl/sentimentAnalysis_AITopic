# Laypeople v.s. Computer Professional's Attitudes

This repository contains the code of my 2019 publication: Using Sentiment Analysis for Comparing Attitudes Between Computer Professionals and Laypersons on the Topic of Artificial Intelligence. 

The code contains the following 4 parts: 1) Extract tweets containing the word 'AI' from Twitter API 2) Preprocess tweets and categorize them based on laypeople and computer professional related occupation words 3) Count each tweet's sentiment score using a sentiment lexicon 4) Conduct statistical test to evaluate the significance between bipolar sentiment scores and occupations.
